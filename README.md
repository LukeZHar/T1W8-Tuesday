# Object Oriented Programming (contd)
- 4 Pillars of oop

## Encapsulation
- Technique of keeping internal state of object hidden from the outside.
- Achieved using private attributes and probiding public methods to access and update them.
- Syntax: __varname

## Abstraction
- Concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only necessary features of an object.
- Achived by using Abstract class and method.

## Abstraction Class and Method
- 
- 

## Inheritance
- Mechanism of creating a new class based on existing class, by inheriting properties (attributes and/or methods)
- Parent Class: The class from where the deatures are inherited from
- Child Class: The class that inherits the features.
- Benefits: Classes are created easily, easy maintenance.

## Polymorphism 
- Ability to present the same interface for differen data types 
- Allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
